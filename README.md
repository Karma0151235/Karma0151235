# Hi. 

I'm a penultimate-semester Computer Science student with a deep interest in quantitative finance, mathematics, and research. I love exploring the intersection of statistical thinking, machine learning, and efficient software development â€” and I'm constantly learning to become a better problem solver and builder.

# Reaching Out

While I'm still early in my journey, I'm excited about the process of learning, improving, and building meaningful things along the way. If you'd like to collaborate on interesting and impactful projects together, please feel free to connect with me through my socials!
